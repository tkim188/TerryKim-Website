        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Hello, my name is Terry Kim and I am a student at University of California Riverside. I am nineteen years old, and am currently a freshman and working towards a degree in Finance and accounting. I have gained my first years of work experience through a tutoring franchise chain called Kumon. I did not want to work, but I would have regret not getting into the workforce any sooner. This job has allowed me to improve myself in every aspect, and has given me the opportunity to learn about being independent as much as I was dependent. I was used interchangeably as a grader, teacher, and data filer. I believe this job has taught me what it is like to work in an office setting, and this has allowed me to get used to the many current platforms like microsoft word, microsoft spreadsheets, microsoft powerpoint, and more.
         Through my experiences working at Kumon, I have learned a great deal about many of the intangible skills I must develop to succeed. Skills such as communication skills seems to be one of the most important when working with other people. When I cannot come into work or if there is an issue in the work space, the communication experiences I have been through has helped me become a more effective co-worker. Another skill I have learned throughout my time at Kumon is time management. From communicating with clientele to the enormous tasks that are given to me, I was able to 
         successfully complete each task with easy and efficiency by breaking up my time in order to work with the stongest mindset. The most important skill I have learned through my first job is the ability to have a positive attitude. This has allowed me to boost company and employee morale, and has allowed me to approach my daily tasks with a better mindset. Not only has this experience allowed me to enter the job market, but it has also given me greater insight on the discipline and responsibilities of working with others. My most memorable experience working at Kumon was my manager. At first, being my employer, I was very intimidated, but over time, I was able to better communicate with her about the future of the branch as well as my own future. She was able to teach me priceless skills and mentality in order for me to set myself up in the best way possible.
          Compared to my colleagues, I was able to gain work experience at a much earlier age, and I was also able to work at a job that can benefit me in the future. From data analysis to computer skills, I was blinded by the fact that these daily routines will allow me to get a headstart in my area of focus. I partially owe my current successes to my first job which has given me the skills to achieve a high grade point average at a competitive highschool, and now university. This has not only allowed me to get into a great college, but has also introduced me to new interests that will help me in the future, stocks<br><br>

        <br>As soon as I started working at Kumon, I got close with one of my co-workers who was interested in the stock market. It started as small talk , and it did not peak my interest until this co-worker showed me his stock portfolio. I was astonished at the amount of success he was able to find through this hobby. This is when I began my first online brokerage account and began to learn about the many indicators and news articles that affect the stock market. In the beginning it was long nights of market analysis, and I finally felt confident investing. I was able to begin with some return on investment, but due to my lack of knowledge and expertise, I began to lose money and was discouraged. However, I am not the type to give up, and as discouraged as I was, I stuck with it, and began to see income little by little. My first stock was Apple (technology company), which was a strong company that had little downside potential. However, I failed to notice that even the best companies have pullbacks coupled with my lack of knowledge that the companies product had malfunctioning errors recently, the stock inevitable decreased dramatically.
        This experience was of course devastating, but there is a quote I learned to listen too which is, "If failure has not paved the way, greatness cannot walk it's path" which has resonated with me and allowed me to persevere such a tragic moment. Although I only had lost about twenty dollars, I was devastated. There were many moment like these, but I made sure to remind myself that this is not the end of opportunities, but the beginning. By the time i had been trading for a while, I was able to control my emotions, and focus more on technical analysis. This is a skill that can only be developed through experience, and I had finally understood that I do not need to be such an emotional trader, and that I should just trust my work ethic. This has ultimately allowed me to build my self confidence and trust in my true capabilities. This was instrumental in my personal development that has only grown through new experiences.
        Now, I am able to to trade with a high success rate and have grown my portfolio to around 10,000 dollars, which is not that big in the larger picture, but every billionaire had to start somewhere. Seeing these number and charts on the screen has at some point made me obsessed with money which has led to negative outcomes, but now I see money as a tool rather than my ultimate goal. Many youngsters can boast that they are investors, but not many can prove they are actual successful investors. The difference is unsurmountable, for the skills and experience required to find success in the stock market is unimaginable. The most important skill I was able to learn through investing is management,
        which has allowed me to use my money wisely as well as thinking rationally. There were many instances where I would impulsively spend large amounts of money on things that I do not need, but through my first job and investing in the stock market, I was able to understand the burden of working for money. This has positively correlated to the way I think. Stocks may sound like risky business, but it is well worth the while if you learn. I am thankful I was able to get myself involved in investing at such a young age, and can only help me grow my wealth and set myself up for success in the future.<br>

       <br><br>As for my academic achievements, I have consistently maintained a average grade point average of 4.0 in highschool and a GPA of 3.6 in college. This may not be the most impressive grade point averages; however, I believe these grades show consistency and honesty in my work, for I have achieved these scores with no academic dishonesty issues on my record while consistently being able to perform at a competitive level. I have always worked hard in all parts of my life, and I feel ready for anything that comes my way. I have always been known to have a consistent and invariant work method that has supported me in every aspect of my life. While many people wonder what they will use their education in the future, I believe that I have developed many intangible skills and experiences through my academic career that will propel me to better myself in the future. One of the most controversial moments through my academics was moving from highschool to college because of the difference in environments and academic 
       differences. College required me to utilize the skills I have developed in highschool, but it was much more difficult to navigate my way through the courses. From having to manage my own eating schedules to other micro tasks that I took for granted were not as available to me as I anticipated. There were many trivial moments where I would not have been able to make it if it were not for my work ethic and organization skills. It was not only taking care of my physical self, but it was also getting used to a new environment and new people. I had to put myself out there, and as an introvert it was very difficult. However, I was able to build my socializing skills through the help of my friends and the support of my former highschool colleague who went to my highschool, Matthew Ko. There is a subtle comfort knowing you are not the only one going through trivial moments, and Matthew was that person for me and vice versa. We joined a Korean Chrisitan Ministry and we became board members for the organization that has ultimately allowed us to build our social skills as well as a community we can depend on. As important it is to be physically independent, a dependence on mental health to an extent is healthy. 
       This has also allowed me to see my position in an optimistic manner, and I see my shortcomings as an opportunity rather than a failure. I can now see that the college route is not only for a higher education, but learning how to essentially grow up and be an adult. Many people tend to form negative notions against this aspect of college, but I have learned how to be an independent individual more than ever through my experience so far in college. Through the hardships and temptations I can confidently say that without failure, I was able to keep a healthy physical and mental life through a robust conversion of lifestyles. This transitional period was critical to the development of my future years, and I believe that as freshman year comes to an end for me, the consistency and healthy lifestyle I have created for myself will been pivotal in my development. I am hopefully not even close to the end of my journey through life, and that may sound scary, but I am optimistic for my future because of the person I am becoming.
